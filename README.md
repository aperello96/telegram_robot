## This project includes some of the basic functions to implement an automated messaging service with Telegram.

### Preliminary Steps before using the code:

To use the Telegram API, you will need a token and a chat ID to identify the conversation.

1. Register with Telegram and start the client using the following process:

```
Start a conversation with @BotFather
```

2. Start the program by clicking the "start" button.

3. Insert the following command to create a new bot:
 
```
/newbot
```
4. The assistant will ask you to choose a name. This is the name users will see, and it doesn't have to be unique:
```
bot_name
```
5. The assistant will also ask for a unique username. It must end with "_bot," for example:
```
bot_name_test_bot
```

6. Finally, the bot will provide you with a unique token for its use.
```
Done! Congratulations on your new bot. You will find it at t.me/nombre_robot_test_bot
. You can now add a description, about section and profile picture for your bot, see /help for a list of commands. By the way, when you've finished creating your cool bot, ping our Bot Support if you want a better username for it. Just make sure the bot is fully operational before you do this.

Use this token to access the HTTP API:
1334584610:AAEPmjlh84N62Lv3jAWEgOftlxfLfMhB1gy
Keep your token secure and store it safely, it can be used by anyone to control your bot.

For a description of the Bot API, see this page: https://core.telegram.org/bots/api
```

7. Get the chat ID:
Start a conversation with the new bot you generated by either opening it directly from the link provided by @BotFather or by searching for the unique name you created.
Send the following message in the chat:
```
/start Hello
```

8. In the same browser, use the following URL, replacing <token> with your generated token:
```
https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates
```
This will return a response like the following, where you will find the chat ID:
```
// 20230629126375
// https://api.telegram.org/bot1334584610:AAEPmjlh84N62Lv3jAWEgOftlxfLfMhB1gy/getUpdates

{
  "ok": true,
  "result": [
    {
      "update_id": 971238617,
      "message": {
        "message_id": 3,
        "from": {
          "id": 5941080371,
          "is_bot": false,
          "first_name": "your_name",
          "last_name": "your_surname",
          "username": "user_name",
          "language_code": "en"
        },
        "chat": {
          "id": 5941080371,
          "first_name": "your_name",
          "last_name": "your_surname",
          "username": "user_name",
          "type": "private"
        },
        "date": 1688027465,
        "text": "Hello"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

9. Create a `.env` file with the token and chat ID:
```
API_TOKEN = '1334584610:AAEPmjlh84N62Lv3jAWEgOftlxfLfMhB1gy'
CHAT_ID = '5941080371'
```
### Installation of Dependencies:
To use the code, you need to install the following libraries:
```
pip install python-dotenv
```

```
pip install requests
```


### Run test_robot.py to receive a message:
Run `test_robot.py` to receive "Hello from Python" and a test image in your Telegram chat.
